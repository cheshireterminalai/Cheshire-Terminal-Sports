 Introdocuing raw data exploration through feature engineering and ends with a Random Forest model to predict whether Kobe’s shot goes in or not. The process is wrapped as a convenient module/function you can integrate anywhere you’d like, and it has been adapted to be your official “Cheshire Terminal Kobe Bryant Shooting Prediction Model for Solana Sports Agent.

Through our  Kaggle Kobe Bryant Shots Dataset (data.csv) in the specified folder, install necessary libraries, and then run this script end-to-end. This script demonstrates data cleaning, EDA (commented out in certain places if you prefer a pure script run), feature engineering, and modeling. Enjoy!
